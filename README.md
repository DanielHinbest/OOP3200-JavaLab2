# OOP3200-JavaLab2
This lab was a collaboration between Daniel Hinbest and Ryan Clayson in Object-Oriented Programming II (OOP 3200) at Durham College. The purpose of this lab is the same as C++ Lab 1 from earlier in the semester. We had to create a Java console application to create a WorkTicket class and allow the user to create work tickets in the console.
